Current societal trends reflect an increased mistrust in science and a lowered 
civic engagement that threaten to impair research that is foundational for 
ensuring public health and advancing health equity. One effective countermeasure 
to these trends lies in community-facing citizen science applications to 
increase public participation in scientific research, making this field an 
important target for artificial intelligence (AI) exploration. We highlight 
potentially promising citizen science AI applications that extend beyond 
individual use to the community level, including conversational large language 
models, text-to-image generative AI tools, descriptive analytics for analyzing 
integrated macro- and micro-level data, and predictive analytics. The novel 
adaptations of AI technologies for community-engaged participatory research also 
bring an array of potential risks. We highlight possible negative externalities 
and mitigations for some of the potential ethical and societal challenges in 
this field.
